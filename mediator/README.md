## Mediator Design Pattern

#### Purpose:
The *Mediator* design pattern is used to reduce the complexity and dependencies between objects by introducing a central point of control (the Mediator) that manages the interactions between the objects. Instead of having every object reference every other object, each object only references the Mediator, which facilitates communication and coordination among them.

#### Key Concepts:

- Loose Coupling: By having a central mediator that handles all communication, the components don't need to know about each other, reducing dependencies and making the system easier to manage and extend.
- Centralized Control: The Mediator pattern centralizes the control logic for interactions, making the behavior of the system easier to modify and understand.
- Simplified Object Collaboration: Without a mediator, objects may need to communicate directly with many other objects, leading to a complex web of dependencies. With a mediator, the interaction logic is encapsulated in one place.


#### When to Use:

- When a system has complex communication logic between many objects, and you want to reduce the dependencies and coupling between those objects.
- When you want to centralize complex communication logic to make it easier to maintain and modify.
- When the communication patterns between objects are difficult to change without affecting many parts of the code.


#### Advantages:

- Reduces Complexity: By centralizing interaction logic, the system becomes less tangled and more manageable.
- Improves Code Maintainability: Modifications to the communication logic only need to be made in the Mediator rather than in multiple places.
- Enhances Flexibility: New object types can be introduced without changing the other object types.


#### Disadvantages:

- Mediator Complexity: The Mediator itself can become complex as it handles more interactions, which might lead to maintenance challenges.
- Single Point of Failure: Since the Mediator manages the interactions, if it becomes overloaded or fails, it can affect the entire system.
