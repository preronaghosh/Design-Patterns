#### Purpose:
The *Memento* design pattern provides a way to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that it can be restored to that state later without violating encapsulation. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to implement features like undo/redo operations.

#### Key Concepts:

- Encapsulation Preservation: The pattern allows you to save and restore the state of an object without exposing its internal structure.
- Time Travel: The Memento pattern can be thought of as enabling "time travel" for an object, where you can save the state at various points and revert to those states later.


#### Three Key Participants:
- Originator: The object whose state is being saved and restored.
- Memento: The object that holds the saved state of the Originator. It should be immutable and should not expose the internal state to other objects.
- Caretaker: The object responsible for storing the Memento and managing the state history.


#### When to Use:

- When you need to implement undo/redo functionality in your application.
- When the internal state of an object needs to be saved periodically and restored when required, such as in simulations or state machines.
- When you want to preserve encapsulation and avoid exposing the internal details of an objectâ€™s state.


#### Advantages:

- State Restoration: The ability to restore an object's state at a later point is a powerful feature, particularly in applications like editors, simulations, or games.
- Encapsulation Protection: The Memento pattern allows for state saving and restoration without exposing the internal state details, maintaining the integrity and encapsulation of the object.
- Simplifies Undo Operations: The pattern makes it easy to implement undo and redo functionalities by saving states at key points.


#### Disadvantages:

- Memory Overhead: Saving states can consume a significant amount of memory, especially if the states are large or frequent state changes are required.
- Complex Caretaker Logic: If the state history is complex or if there are many different states to manage, the Caretaker logic can become intricate and hard to maintain.
- Limited Use Case: The Memento pattern is primarily useful in scenarios where state restoration is required. It might not be appropriate for all situations.
