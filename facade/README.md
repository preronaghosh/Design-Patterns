### Key Characteristics of the Facade Pattern:
- *Simplified Interface*: The facade class offers a simplified and unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. This makes the subsystem easier to use by hiding its complexity.
- *Decoupling*: The facade pattern decouples the client code from the subsystem, promoting loose coupling. Clients interact with the facade rather than directly with the subsystem classes.
- *Single Point of Access*: The facade acts as a single point of access to the subsystem, which can reduce the dependencies of the client code on the internal workings of the subsystem.
- *Enhancing Readability*: By providing a higher-level abstraction, the facade can make the code more readable and maintainable.
