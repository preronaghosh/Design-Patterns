- The factory pattern is a creational design pattern used in software development to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when the details of object creation processes are meant to be hidden from the consuming code to ease the management of object creation and to make the system more modular.

- How It Works:
    - The factory method is called with certain parameters. Based on these parameters, it decides which particular concrete product to instantiate.
    - The method then returns the new product cast to the interface of the abstract product class. This allows the code that uses the factory method to operate independently from the specific types of products that are created.
