1. Define a family of algorithms, each encapsulated in a separate class.
2. Declare an interface (or use an abstract class) common to all supported algorithms, ensuring they follow the same contract. Interfaces have abstract strategies. This is not instantiable. Their derived strategy classes are instantiable.
3. Use constructor injection to inject the right strategy into this interface.
4. In the context class, maintain a reference to the apt strategy interface, allowing it to switch between different algorithms.
5. The client can then choose the appropriate algorithm and set it in the context class.
