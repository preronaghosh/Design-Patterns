1. Define a family of algorithms, each encapsulated in a separate class.
2. Declare an interface (or use an abstract class) common to all supported algorithms, ensuring they follow the same contract.
3. In the context class, maintain a reference to the strategy interface, allowing it to switch between different algorithms.
4. The client can then choose the appropriate algorithm and set it in the context class.
