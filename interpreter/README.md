### Interpreter Pattern
The *Interpreter Pattern* is a behavioral design pattern that defines a way to evaluate sentences in a language. It is used to interpret expressions or sentences and can be used for simple scripting languages, parsing, and other language processing applications.

#### Key Concepts

- Abstract Expression: Declares an abstract interpret operation that is common to all nodes in the abstract syntax tree.
- Terminal Expression: Implements an interpret operation associated with terminal symbols in the grammar.
- Non-terminal Expression: Implements an interpret operation for non-terminal symbols in the grammar, and typically calls the interpret operations on its children.
- Context: Contains information that is global to the interpreter.


#### Structure
- Abstract Expression: Defines the interpret interface.
- Terminal Expression: Implements interpret for terminal symbols.
- Non-terminal Expression: Implements interpret for non-terminal symbols and uses other expressions to process parts of the grammar.
- Context: Carries information needed during interpretation.

#### Advantages of the Interpreter Pattern

- Easy to change and extend the grammar: You can easily add new expressions by creating new classes.
- Readable and maintainable: The pattern makes it easier to understand and maintain the code that processes complex expressions.

#### When to Use the Interpreter Pattern
- When you have a simple language or grammar to interpret.
- When you want to represent the grammar as a class hierarchy.
- When you can leverage the composite design pattern to represent the grammar.
