*The Visitor Design Pattern* is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing class hierarchies without modifying those classes. It achieves this by separating the algorithm from the object structure on which it operates.

*When to use*:
- When you have a complex object structure with multiple types of elements
- When you need to add new operations to the object structure without modifying existing classes
- When you want to keep related behaviors together
- When the behavior depends on the type of the object
- When you want to achieve double dispatch, which means the behavior executed depends on both the type of the visitor and the type of the element being visited
